# Star Wars Squadrons Warthog Script
Thrustmaster Warthog Script for Star Wars Squadrons
## ##
## Latest build # 1.0.0

By @MBroholmA

## Features ##
- Use the INCR/DECR lever to add yaw-on-roll effect. Middle = 0 = no effect. The further from the middle the longer the yaw will be applied.
- Use the AUTOPILOT switch on the throttle to mix the axis on the rudder pedals differently
- Binds the JOYX/JOYX axes to DX_XROT_AXIS/DX_YROT_AXIS - irrelevant now that this bug was patched
- Introduces a dead zone around 50% throttle for maximum turn rate

## Requirements ##
- TARGET software 3.0.18.328

## Installation and setup ##
1. Download the "Star Wars Squadrons.tmc" file or clone the repo.
2. Edit the axes mappings in the script for your preferences
3. Run the script from the TARGET software
4. Make sure the physical devices are hidden - otherwise the game might pick up the axes from there. Try reconnecting the controllers and restart the script
5. Bind the axes in game

## Acknowledgements ##
Aussiedroid's Elite Dangerous Script (https://github.com/Aussiedroid/AD-EDWarthogEnhancedScript) was an inspiration to see what is able to be done with the TARGET software.
And a big thanks to all others who posted their script examples
